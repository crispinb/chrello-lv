# Chrello

## Purpose
This has 2 aims: 
1. for me to learn a bit more about Phoenix LiveView
1. as a proof-of-concept of what seems in principle a nice idea (to provide a Trelloish view of a Checkvist list)

## Scope


Given the difficulty (inherent to software it seems) of keeping ambitions in check, and my own lack of Phoenix LiveView skill, I'll start with these limits in mind: 
* The board <-> Checkvist list mapping will be the simplest possible: one list, one board. Each top level list item is a column. Each first level list item is a card. Behaviour for sub-items, and a bunch of other things, is undefined, making Chrello much like C. Chrello may be more colourful than C when I have Tailwind mastered though.

## FAQ
* *isn't "Chrello" a ridiculous name*?

    Yes but I am English so that's OK. 
    
* *mightn't the name be a trademark violation*?

    Probably but that's OK too because I'm also Australianish.
